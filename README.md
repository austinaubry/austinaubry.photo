INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING / ADDING NEW PHOTOS:
1. Drop a .jpg into the 'images' folder (must be a .jpg to work)
2. Rename the file with the number in which you want it to appear, i.e. 12.jpg (Note that in the code, the first number in the list is 0)
3. Go to sketch.js (this is the main script)
4. If it changes, update the **numImages** variable to match your total number of images (this is the total number of images in your images folder. so 0.jpg-11.jpg is technically 12 images)
5. Update the **imageLinks** variable so the newly uploaded image redirects the user to the right webpage. Links are assigned in the order of the images. (note that there needs to be a comma after every link, except for the last one)
6. If necesary, update the values for the **desktopRow** and **mobileRow** variables. As their names imply, these affect the layout of how many images are placed in a row.
